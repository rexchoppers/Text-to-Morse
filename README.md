# Text To Morse

Small prototype/side project for learning morse code, converting sentences into morse code and gives me an excuse to use Java

This project probably won't have anything else added to it but I'll keep it up to date where possible

Tested with OpenJDK 18 + JavaFX 19
## Installation

1. Install Java (If you haven't already)
2. Install JavaFX (If you haven't already)
3. Clone `git@github.com:rexchoppers/Text-to-Morse.git`
4. Setup your IDE Run/Build configuration to import and use the JavaFX library

I'm using Intellij for all Java related stuff. More information about how to use JavaFX with your IDE can be found at https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/
